# Diabetis-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on certain features or variables. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of diabetes, aiding in early detection and proactive healthcare management.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database].
It consists of  instances and includes several features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and glucose levels. The dataset also provides binary labels indicating the presence or absence of diabetes for each instance.

Usage
To use the diabetes prediction model:

Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies (see Installation section).

Prepare your input data in the required format. Ensure that the feature variables align with the model's input specifications.

Execute the prediction code, either by running the provided script or by incorporating the required functions into your own codebase.

Obtain the prediction results, which will indicate the likelihood of diabetes for each input instance.

Model Training and Evaluation
In this project, we employ a RandomTree Classification  for training the diabetes prediction model.
